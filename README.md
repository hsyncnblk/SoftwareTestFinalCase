## Installation 

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

   **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**:
   -  Use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows), [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), or other IDEs to organize and run tests.

   **Git** ‚Äì For cloning the repository:
   - Install Git from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/) if it's not already installed.

   **Allure Command Line** (Optional for report generation):
   - Install Allure by following the instructions on [Allure's GitHub page](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure2).



### Project Setup & Execution

Clone the Project Repository:

 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/hsyncnblk/SoftwareTestFinalCase.git
```

Navigate to the Project Directory

 ```bash
cd SoftwareTestFinalCase
```

Open the Project in Your IDE

Open IntelliJ IDEA, click on Open, and navigate to the cloned project directory (SoftwareTestFinalCase). Select the folder and open it.

Install Project Dependencies

mvn clean install
 ```

 you can choose and run any specific test file from the **test** folder based on your needs. Simply select the test file you want to execute and run it using your IDE's run options.

 Generate Reports 
 ```bash
 allure serve allure-results
```


## Explanation:

- **allure-results**: Directory where Allure test reports are generated.
- **ExtentReports/ExtentReportResults.html**: The HTML file containing the Extent Report of the test execution.
- **jmatter-result**: Directory for storing JMeter performance testing results.

- **src/main/java/pages**:
  - **BasePage.java**: This is an abstract class that reduces code duplication for common page functionalities.
  - Each page class in this folder contains its own specific locators and methods related to the page.

- **src/main/java/utils**:
  - **Log.java**: Utility class for logging test execution details.
  - **ScreenshotHelper.java**: Utility class for capturing screenshots during tests.
  - **WebDriverFactory.java**: Factory class that initializes and provides WebDriver instances.

- **src/test/java/tests**:
  - **BaseTest.java**: Base class that contains common test setup and teardown methods that can be extended by individual test classes.
  - Contains various test classes for testing the application.

- **src/test/java/utils/ExtentReports**:
  - **ExtentManager.java**: Manages the configuration and setup of Extent Reports.
  - **ExtentTestManager.java**: Manages the individual test execution logs in Extent Reports.

- **src/test/java/utils/Listener**:
  - **TestListeners.java**: Contains custom listeners used for test execution, such as capturing screenshots when a test fails.

- **src/test/resources**:
  - **screenshots**: Directory where all the screenshots taken during test execution will be stored.
  - **log4j2.xml**: Configuration file for Log4j2 to manage logging during test execution.


- **pom.xml**: The Maven configuration file that manages all the project dependencies.

This structure helps maintain a clean, scalable, and organized test automation framework.
